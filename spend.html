  <!-- Intro Text -->
  <p>
    Project Spend uses official Treasury data to produce breakdowns of public expenditure 
    in an easy to read and visual format. The following data views are currently available:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Spend Through Time:</b> public expenditure through time, shown both in nominal GBP and as a percentage of GDP.</li>
    <li><b>Spend by Department:</b> public expenditure broken down by Government Department.</li>
    <li><b>Economic Category Spend:</b> public expenditure broken down by economic category (e.g. pay, procurement, grants).</li>
    <li><b>Spend by Function:</b> public expenditure broken down by functional area (e.g. Defence, Health, Education). 
      Although similar to departmental spend, as departments are often defined by a functional area, this view tracks spend 
      according to what the funds are spent on rather than which department spends the money.</li>
  </ul>
